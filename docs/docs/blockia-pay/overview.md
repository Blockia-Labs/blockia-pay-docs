# Blockia Pay Overview

Blockia Pay is a next-generation fintech infrastructure company bridging
traditional capital markets with the future of digital assets. We're powering
the agentic economy with instant payments, smart wallets, and autonomous
financial rails built for the future of commerce.

## Core Philosophy

**Accept payments in seconds. No banks. No delays. Just pure financial
infrastructure.**

Our platform provides a simple, non-custodial payment solution: a shareable
payment link that lets clients pay in digital assets directly to the merchant's
wallet. This approach removes the usual headaches of crypto payments (no need
for a website integration or advanced crypto knowledge).

## Key Features

### ⚡ Instant Global Payments

Accept payments from anywhere in the world in seconds with direct blockchain
settlement.

### 🔐 Smart Account Wallets

Passkey authentication with no seed phrases required. Users authenticate via
device biometrics (fingerprint, FaceID) for a seamless experience.

### 💸 Non-Custodial Settlement

All payments settle directly on-chain to the user's own wallet. Our platform
never custody funds - users maintain full control at all times.

### 🔗 Payment Links

Shareable URLs for seamless crypto payments. No complex integrations or website
changes needed.

### 📊 Financial Dashboard

Real-time payment tracking and analytics with export capabilities for accounting
and reconciliation.

### 🏗️ Developer APIs

Comprehensive APIs for building on tomorrow's financial infrastructure.

## Target Users

### Freelancers & Consultants

accounts or complex setup.

### Small Online Merchants

Solo entrepreneurs selling through social media or simple websites who need
payment processing without full e-commerce platforms.

### Physical Micro-Merchants
